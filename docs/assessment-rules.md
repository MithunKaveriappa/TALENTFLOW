# Assessment Rules & Security Policies

To ensure the integrity and authenticity of the platform, the following strict rules are enforced for all users (Candidates and Recruiters).

## 1. Zero-Strike/Two-Strike Policies

- **Tab Switching (Anti-Cheat)**:
  - The platform tracks `visibilitychange` events.
  - **1st Switch**: A warning is displayed.
  - **2nd Switch**: Immediate session termination. The user is added to the `blocked_users` table and permanently banned from the platform.
- **Copy-Paste**: Prohibited during the assessment. Standard browser shortcuts and context menus are disabled.

## 2. Session Integrity

- **Postponement Allowed**: Candidates can choose to take the assessment later. They can still access the dashboard to browse, but key features (applying to jobs, verified badge) remain locked.
- **Retake & Best Score Logic**:
  - Candidates can retake the assessment via Profile Settings.
  - The system keeps the **higher of the two scores**: $final = MAX(old, new)$.
  - Users are never penalized for a poor retake attempt.
- **Identity Persistence**: If a candidate has already completed Aadhaar/KYC verification, it is **persisted** even across retakes.
- **Time Boxing**:
  - **Standard Questions**: **60 seconds** limit.
  - **Skill Case Studies**: **90-120 seconds** limit (depending on complexity).
  - Failure to answer within the time limit results in a zero-score for that specific response.

## 3. Recruiter-Specific Rules (Competitive Progress)

- **Institutional Score**: Multiple recruiters from the same company can take the assessment.
- **Improvement Logic**: The Company Profile Score (CPS) only updates if a teammate achieves a higher score than the current baseline.
- **Inheritance**: New recruiters can choose to skip the assessment and use the existing company score if it has already been generated by a colleague.

## 3. Input Quality

- **Meaningful Responses**: Brief, one-word, or nonsensical answers are flagged by the AI Grader and results in a 0.0 score across all dimensions.
- **Authenticity**: The system is optimized for voice input (Web Speech API) to encourage natural, unscripted responses.

## 4. Consequences of Violation

- **Permanent Ban**: Users in the `blocked_users` table will see a "Your account has been permanently blocked" message upon login.
- **Score Penalty**: Frequent timeouts or low-quality signals will result in a Profile Score below 40, which locks access to premium features and recruiter dashboards.

* Answers are not stored, only scores and confidence
* Assessment impacts profile score permanently
